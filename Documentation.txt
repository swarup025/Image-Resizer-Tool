ðŸ’» HOW IT WORKS
â­• User Input: The program prompts the user to enter the path of the image
 file they want to resize.
â­• Image Loading: It reads the image from the specified path using
 cv2.imread().
â­• Resize Dimensions: The user is asked to provide the new width and 
 height for the image.
â­• Image Resizing: The image is resized to the specified dimensions using
 cv2.resize().
â­• Display:Both the original and resized images are displayed using
 cv2.imshow().
â­• Save or Close: If the user presses the "s" key, the resized image is saved to
 a specified location. If any other key is pressed, the program closes the
 display windows.

ðŸ‘‰ NOTE :
 ðŸ‘‰ Ensure you handle cases where the image path might be invalid.
 ðŸ‘‰ Correct the condition to check the key press (if k == ord("s") should be
 properly indented).
 ðŸ‘‰ The method to close the windows should be cv2.destroyAllwindows()
 ,not cv2.destroyAllwindows().
